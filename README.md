# 🌦 Weather Analysis Dashboard 
This repository contains an *interactive Weather Dashboard* built using live API data. The dashboard provides real-time insights into temperature, forecasts, air quality, and other environmental factors for different cities. It is designed for continuous updates, ensuring accurate and up-to-date weather information. 

## 📊 Key Features 
*Current Temperature:* Live updates with weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain). - 
*Humidity:* Tracks real-time moisture levels. - 
*Wind Speed & Direction:* Displays live wind conditions. -
*Visibility & Pressure:* Key atmospheric conditions. - 
*7-Day Forecast:* Future temperature trends with daily highs/lows. - 
*Sunrise & Sunset:* Accurate timings based on geolocation. - 
*Air Quality Index (AQI):* Provides pollution and air safety levels. - 
*Chance of Rain:* Probability of rainfall across the week. 

## 📌 Dashboard Insights
- *City-wise Analysis:* Weather conditions for multiple cities (e.g., Ambala, Panipat). -
*Daily & Weekly Forecasts:* Interactive trend visualization for temperature and rainfall. -
*Air Quality Tracking:* AQI levels categorized into safe and unsafe zones. - *Environmental KPIs:* Visibility, precipitation, and UV index.

##Visualizations Used: 
 Line chart for temperature trends 
 Bar chart for rainfall probability 
 KPI cards for key weather stats
 Gauge/Pie chart for AQI index  
 Sun/Moon icons for sunrise/sunset representation
